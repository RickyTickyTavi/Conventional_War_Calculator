# Conventional_War_Calculator
Taken using the theories of "The calculus of conventional war"

This was a program that was required by my university for our class titled "Principles of Programming languages".

It was taken from a Professor Epstein's (no, not the Epstein that did not kill himself in prison) book called "The Calculus of Conventional War"

It doesn't really do much besides calculate losses based on starting forces and attrition rates, but I think it's a pretty neat nonetheless.

COMPILATION::

  To compile the program. The easiest would be to simply double click on it if you already have the Haskell terminal.
  If you dont already have the platform, go here: https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#platform   and follow the instructions.

  There are 3 commands you will have to type in order to see every value required of the project.
  They all match Epstein's (no, not the Epstein that did not kill himself in prison) values so please check them.

COMMANDS AND USAGE::

  First command: forces(type exactly as seen)

    an input prompt will ask you for the values you wish to see
    type the units you wish to see and give the number of days on the second input prompt. (DO NOT ENTER THE DAY BEFORE YOU ARE   PROMPTED) Everything needs to be typed very exact to work.
    
    type: attackingForces    -      you will see the number of attacking forces
    type: defendingForces    -      you will see the number of defending forces
    type: attackersAirSupport    -      you will see the number of attacking forces aircraft
    type: defendersAirSupport    -      you will see the number of defending forces aircraft    
    
    
  Second command: rates(same set of prelim instructions as above)

    type: attackersAttrition    -      you will see the attacking forces attrition rate
    type: defendersAttrition    -      you will see the defending forces attrition rate
    type: attackersGroundProsecutionRate    -      you will see the rate of the attacking forces ground to ground prosecution
    type: defendersWithdrawalRate    -      you will see the rate of the defenders retreat    
    
    
  Third command: displacementOfFront (days argument goes here)- you will see the kilometers displaced by the battle
  ^^^^^ For this one, type in displacementOfFront followed by a number to see the values  ^^^^^^^


  Again, as long as the inputs are typed as they are given here, the program will work as intended.

  Enjoy!
